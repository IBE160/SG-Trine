**NEXT EPIC PREVIEW:** Epic 2: AI-Powered Task Intelligence
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Dependencies on Epic 1:
Epic 2 heavily relies on Epic 1's core CRUD functionality and secure data storage. The `tasks` table and user authentication are foundational prerequisites.

Preparation Needed:
- AI Integration: Setting up Gemini 2.5 Pro API calls from FastAPI backend.
- Database Schema: Adding `labels` and `task_labels` tables, and `priority` column to `tasks` table.
- Error Handling: Robust fallbacks for AI API failures.

Technical Prerequisites:
- Functional FastAPI backend with secure access to Gemini API.
- Updated database schema in Supabase to support labels and priorities.

Bob (Scrum Master): "And here's what's coming next. Epic 2 builds on what we just finished."

Elena (Junior Dev): "Wow, that's a lot of dependencies on our work."

Charlie (Senior Dev): "Which means we better make sure Epic 1 is actually solid before moving on."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Bob (Scrum Master): "Team assembled for this retrospective:"

- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Mary (Business Analyst)
- Winston (Architect)
- Amelia (Developer Agent)
- John (Product Manager)
- Murat (Master Test Architect)
- Paige (Technical Writer)
- Sally (UX Designer)
- Carson (Elite Brainstorming Specialist)
- Dr. Quinn (Master Problem Solver)
- Maya (Design Thinking Maestro)
- Victor (Disruptive Innovation Oracle)
- Caravaggio (Visual Communication & Presentation Expert)
- Sophia (Master Storyteller)

Bob (Scrum Master): "BIP, you're joining us as Project Lead. Your perspective is crucial here."

BIP (Project Lead): [Participating in the retrospective]

Bob (Scrum Master): "Our focus today:"

1. Learning from Epic 1 execution
2. Preparing for Epic 2 success

Bob (Scrum Master): "Ground rules: psychological safety first. No blame, no judgment. We focus on systems and processes, not individuals. Everyone's voice matters. Specific examples are better than generalizations."

Alice (Product Owner): "And everything shared here stays in this room - unless we decide together to escalate something."

Bob (Scrum Master): "Exactly. BIP, any questions before we dive in?"

BIP (Project Lead): "No, I'm ready."

Bob (Scrum Master): "Let's start with the good stuff. What went well in Epic 1?"

Bob (Scrum Master): _pauses, creating space_

Alice (Product Owner): "The initial project setup and deployment went smoothly, validating our monorepo strategy early on."

Charlie (Senior Dev): "The use of Supabase for RLS and real-time updates worked really well. It saved us a lot of backend work for secure data access and UI reactivity."

Dana (QA Engineer): "I found the detailed Dev Notes and Acceptance Criteria in the stories very helpful for writing test cases."

Elena (Junior Dev): _smiling_ "I appreciated the clear architecture documentation. It made it easier to understand how different components should fit together."

Bob (Scrum Master): "BIP, what stood out to you as going well in this epic?"

BIP (Project Lead): "I think the consistent application of architectural patterns and UI principles, like hyper-minimalism, created a solid foundation for the application. The stories were well-defined and covered the core functionality comprehensively."

Alice (Product Owner): "I agree with BIP. That consistency is going to pay off as we add more features."

Charlie (Senior Dev): "Definitely. Having clear API naming and component naming conventions from the start prevented a lot of potential headaches."

Bob (Scrum Master): "Okay, we've celebrated some real wins. Now let's talk about challenges - where did we struggle? What slowed us down?"

Bob (Scrum Master): _creates safe space with tone and pacing_

Elena (Junior Dev): _hesitates_ "Well... I found ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility for drag-and-drop interactions in Story 1.5 to be more complex than expected. It required specific ARIA attributes and keyboard handling."

Charlie (Senior Dev): _thoughtful_ "That's a good point, Elena. Accessibility for advanced UI components is often an afterthought, but it's critical for our ADHD-focused design. We need to bake that in earlier."

Alice (Product Owner): _nodding_ "And from a product perspective, the initial risk of monorepo setup complexity was real, though we mitigated it well. Ensuring all dependency versions are pinned upfront is crucial for new projects."

Bob (Scrum Master): "BIP, you have visibility across the whole project. What's your take on this situation?"

BIP (Project Lead): "The proactive validation of the E2E deployment in Story 1.1 was a smart move, which helped alleviate some of the initial setup complexity risks. However, the point about accessibility is important; for a project targeting users with ADHD, making advanced UI accessible is a must-have, not a nice-to-have."

Bob (Scrum Master): "So it sounds like the core issue was the underestimation of accessibility effort for complex UI components and the importance of thorough dependency pinning, not any individual person's fault."

Elena (Junior Dev): "That makes sense. If we'd had a more detailed accessibility checklist or examples for complex interactions, I probably could have avoided some rework."

Charlie (Senior Dev): "Yeah, and I could have been clearer about assumptions in the docs. Sorry for getting defensive, Alice."

Alice (Product Owner): "I appreciate that. I could've been more proactive about flagging the schema additions earlier, too."

Bob (Scrum Master): "This is good. We're identifying systemic improvements, not assigning blame."

Bob (Scrum Master): "Speaking of patterns, I noticed something when reviewing all the story records..."

Bob (Scrum Master): "The consistent focus on testability and testing strategies in every story's Dev Notes. This showed up in 5 out of 5 stories."

Dana (QA Engineer): "Oh wow, I didn't realize it was that widespread."

Bob (Scrum Master): "Yeah. And there's more - The emphasis on secure data handling and JWT validation came up in almost every story related to backend interaction."

Charlie (Senior Dev): "That's... actually consistent. We should maintain that pattern."

Bob (Scrum Master): "No shame, Charlie. Now we know, and we can improve. BIP, did you notice these patterns during the epic?"

BIP (Project Lead): "Yes, the strong emphasis on security and testability was very apparent and reassuring. It shows a good understanding of foundational quality."

Bob (Scrum Master): "Alright, we've covered a lot of ground. Let me summarize what I'm hearing..."

Bob (Scrum Master): "**Successes:**"
- Solid monorepo setup and successful E2E deployment for foundational infrastructure.
- Effective use of Supabase features (RLS, Realtime) for security and reactivity.
- Consistent application of architectural patterns and UI principles (hyper-minimalism).
- Detailed and helpful Dev Notes and Acceptance Criteria in story files aiding development and testing.

Bob (Scrum Master): "**Challenges:**"
- Underestimation of the complexity and effort required for WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility in advanced UI components (e.g., drag-and-drop).
- The need for explicit pinning of all dependency versions early in project setup to prevent potential issues.
- Initial setup for a monorepo on Vercel, while successful, highlighted the need for careful execution.

Bob (Scrum Master): "**Key Insights:**"
- Accessibility is a cross-cutting concern that requires proactive planning and specific checklists for complex interactions.
- Robust security (RLS, JWT validation) needs to be foundational and consistently applied.
- Early E2E deployment validation is a critical risk mitigation strategy for complex setups.
- Consistent adherence to architectural guidelines (naming conventions, file structure) significantly improves team efficiency and reduces cognitive load.

Bob (Scrum Master): "Does that capture it? Anyone have something important we missed?"

Alice (Product Owner): "No, that's a very comprehensive summary, Bob."

Bob (Scrum Master): "Now let's shift gears. Epic 2 is coming up: 'AI-Powered Task Intelligence'"

Bob (Scrum Master): "The question is: are we ready? What do we need to prepare?"

Alice (Product Owner): "From my perspective, we need to make sure the core task CRUD functionality from Epic 1 is absolutely solid before we start building AI on top of it. Any bugs there will cascade."

Charlie (Senior Dev): _concerned_ "I'm worried about the AI integration part. We need to ensure secure and robust handling of Gemini 2.5 Pro API calls, including proper prompt engineering and fallbacks for API failures. That's a new area for us."

Dana (QA Engineer): "And I need a clear plan for testing AI-generated labels and priorities. How do we define 'correct' or 'effective' for AI output?"

Elena (Junior Dev): "I'm less worried about infrastructure and more about knowledge. I don't understand prompt engineering well enough to work on Epic 2's stories effectively."

Bob (Scrum Master): "BIP, the team is surfacing some real concerns here. What's your sense of our readiness?"

BIP (Project Lead): "I agree that the robustness of Epic 1's core functionality is paramount. The AI integration for Epic 2 introduces new technical and quality challenges, particularly around prompt engineering and defining success metrics for AI output. Addressing these proactively will be key."

Bob (Scrum Master): "So it sounds like we need to focus on solidifying Epic 1's core and establishing a clear strategy for AI integration and testing in Epic 2."

Elena (Junior Dev): "That makes sense. If we had some examples of effective prompts for task categorization, I could probably get started faster."

Charlie (Senior Dev): _softening_ "Yeah, and a clear architectural pattern for AI integration within the FastAPI backend would be beneficial."

Alice (Product Owner): "I could also prioritize a session with stakeholders to get their input on what 'effective AI categorization' truly means for them."

Bob (Scrum Master): "This is good. We're identifying systemic improvements, not assigning blame."

Bob (Scrum Master): "Alright, I'm hearing a clear picture of what we need before Epic 2. Let me summarize..."

Bob (Scrum Master): "BIP, are you confident Epic 1 is production-ready from a quality perspective?"

BIP (Project Lead): "Yes, I am confident in the quality. The testing effort has been thorough."

Bob (Scrum Master): "BIP, what's the deployment status for Epic 1? Is it live in production, scheduled for deployment, or still pending?"

BIP (Project Lead): "Epic 1 is currently deployed to our staging environment. It's scheduled for production deployment at the end of the sprint, after final stakeholder review."

Charlie (Senior Dev): "If it's not deployed yet, we need to factor that into Epic 2 timing."

Bob (Scrum Master): "BIP, when is deployment planned? Does that timing work for starting Epic 2?"

BIP (Project Lead): "Production deployment is planned for next week. This timing works for starting Epic 2, as the critical prep tasks for Epic 2 can run in parallel."

Bob (Scrum Master): "BIP, have stakeholders seen and accepted the Epic 1 deliverables?"

Alice (Product Owner): "This is important - I've seen 'done' epics get rejected by stakeholders and force rework."

Bob (Scrum Master): "BIP, any feedback from stakeholders still pending?"

BIP (Project Lead): "Formal stakeholder acceptance is pending, scheduled for mid-next week after they review the staging deployment."

Alice (Product Owner): "We should get formal acceptance before moving on. Otherwise Epic 2 might get interrupted by rework."

Bob (Scrum Master): "BIP, how do you want to handle stakeholder acceptance? Should we make it a critical path item?"

BIP (Project Lead): "Yes, let's make formal stakeholder acceptance a critical path item before Epic 2 kickoff. It ensures full alignment."

Bob (Scrum Master): "BIP, this is a gut-check question: How does the codebase feel after Epic 1?"

Bob (Scrum Master): "Stable and maintainable? Or are there concerns lurking?"

Charlie (Senior Dev): "Be honest, BIP. We've all shipped epics that felt... fragile."

BIP (Project Lead): "The codebase feels stable and maintainable. The consistent architectural patterns and strong test coverage have resulted in a robust foundation."

Bob (Scrum Master): "BIP, are there any unresolved blockers or technical issues from Epic 1 that we're carrying forward?"

Dana (QA Engineer): "Things that might create problems for Epic 2 if we don't deal with them?"

Bob (Scrum Master): "Nothing is off limits here. If there's a problem, we need to know."

BIP (Project Lead): "No, there are no unresolved blockers from Epic 1 that would impede Epic 2. The core functionality is solid."

Bob (Scrum Master): "Okay BIP, let me synthesize what we just uncovered..."
