**Checklist:** .bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/create-ux-design/checklist.md
**Date:** 2025-11-27

## Summary

  - The file lacks a side-by-side comparison feature.
  - The user's final selection of a color theme is not documented.

## Section Results

### 3. Visual Collaboration Artifacts - Color Theme Visualizer

- **PASS** - HTML file exists and is valid.
- **PASS** - 4 theme options are shown.
- **PASS** - Each theme has a complete palette.
- **PARTIAL** - Live UI component examples are only shown for the "Refined Focus" theme, not for all themes.
- **FAIL** - No side-by-side comparison is enabled.
- **FAIL** - User's selection is not documented in the main specification.

## Recommendations
- Add live UI component examples for all themes to allow for a better comparison.
- Implement a side-by-side comparison feature to improve the user experience of the visualizer.
- After the user makes a choice, document it in the main `ux-design-specification.md` file.
